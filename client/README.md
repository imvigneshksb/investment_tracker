## Deployment to Zoho Catalyst

1. Upload the entire `client` folder contents to your Zoho Catalyst static hosting
2. Set `index.html` as the entry point
3. The folder structure follows standard web hosting conventions

## File Organization

- **HTML**: Main application structure in `index.html`
- **CSS**: All styling in `css/styles.css` with updated path references
- **JavaScript**: All functionality in `js/script.js` with updated path references
- **Data**: User data storage in `userData.json`

## Path Updates

All file references have been updated for the new folder structure:

- CSS: `href="css/styles.css"`

This structure is optimized for Zoho Catalyst free tier hosting requirements.
